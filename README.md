# bond-market-rl
RL-based bond market portfolio optimizer using PPO

This project applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to simulate and optimize bond trading decisions based on real market data sourced from the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE).

It builds a basic RL environment that models bond market trading decisions like Buy, Sell, and Hold and trains an agent to maximize returns while managing a portfolio.

# Bond Market Portfolio Building with Reinforcement Learning 🧠📈

This project uses a custom OpenAI Gym environment and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN agent using PyTorch) to simulate and optimize portfolio strategies in a bond market.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3
- **Environment:** Custom bond market environment
- **Agent:** Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- **Goal:** Learn trading strategies that maximize long-term portfolio returns.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym / Gymnasium
- Stable-Baselines3

## 📊 Key Features
- Custom reward mechanism based on bond returns
- Visualization of rewards and actions
- Model training and evaluation using PPO or DQN

## 📁 Files
- `bond_market_rl_agent.ipynb` – The main notebook
- `custom_env.py` – Custom Gym environment for bond market (*if separated later*)
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies (to be added)

## 💡 Future Plans
- Add support for multi-agent simulation
- Integrate real-world financial data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance)
- Improve training stability
